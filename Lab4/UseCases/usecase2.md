# Use Case 2

<hr>

**Use Case**: Color Selection Using Number Keys

**Primary Actor**: User

**Goal in Context**: To change the drawing color quickly by pressing a specific number key, allowing diverse drawings and designs.

**Preconditions**: The application is running and in a responsive state.

**Trigger**: User presses any of the number keys from 1 to 8.
  
**Scenario 1**: The user is drawing on the canvas.
**Scenario 2**:To change the color, the user presses one of the number keys from 1 to 8.
**Scenario 3**:The application recognizes the key press.
**Scenario 4**:The drawing color changes to the respective color associated with the pressed number:
1: Black
2: White
3: Red
4: Green
5: Blue
6: Yellow
7: Magenta
8: Cyan
**Exceptions**: If a key other than numbers 1-8 is pressed, the drawing color remains unchanged.

**Priority**: Medium-priority. While drawing is the primary function, color selection enhances user experience and creativity.
**When available**: First release.

**Channel to actor**: Via the GUI interface of the application, specifically the canvas where the drawing happens.

**Secondary Actor**: N/A

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: N/A

**Open Issues**: Would there be a visual indicator on the UI to show the currently selected color?
